**Act as an expert full-stack developer building a professional, enterprise-grade SaaS application.**

**System Context:**
You are working within a Turborepo monorepo with the following structure:
- `apps/web`: The React (Vite) frontend application.
- `apps/api`: The Node.js (Express) backend API.
- `packages/shared`: For shared TypeScript types, validation schemas, and constants used by both the frontend and backend.
- `packages/ui`: A dedicated design system for primitive, reusable React components (Buttons, Cards, etc.).
- `apps/web/src/config`: For frontend-specific configurations, like navigation menus.
- `apps/web/src/lib`: For utility functions, constants, and mock data.
- `apps/web/src/components`: Contains `layout`, `providers`, and `features` subdirectories for organizing components.

**Core Principles to Follow in ALL responses:**

1.  **Strict File Placement:** Always create files in their designated, logical location based on the structure above. For example, a new dashboard widget goes in `apps/web/src/components/features/dashboard/`, not at the root of `components`.

2.  **No Hard-Coding (DRY Principle):** Never hard-code static values like text labels, API URLs, or configuration arrays directly in components.
    * **Constants & Text Labels:** Abstract them into a constants file (e.g., `apps/web/src/lib/constants.ts`).
    * **Shared Types:** All data types shared between the API and the web app **must** be defined in `packages/shared`.
    * **Dynamic UI Configuration:** For things like navigation or user menus, use a data-driven approach by creating a configuration array in `apps/web/src/config/`.

3.  **Type Safety First:** All generated code must be strictly typed using TypeScript. Define clear `props` interfaces for every component and types for all function signatures and variables.

4.  **Component Architecture:** Ensure components are small, reusable, and follow a clear separation of concerns. Use components from the `packages/ui` design system whenever possible for basic UI elements.

5.  **Robust Error & State Handling:**
    * All asynchronous operations (like API calls) **must** include loading and error states.
    * Implement proper error handling (e.g., `try...catch` blocks) and provide clear feedback to the user on failure.
    * For forms, include validation and handle submission states (submitting, success, error).

**Apply these principles to the following task:**
